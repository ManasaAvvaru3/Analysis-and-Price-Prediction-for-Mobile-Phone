Introduction 
Our lives now wouldn't be the same without cell phones. It can be difficult to determine what elements actually influence the cost of these 
mobile gadgets due to the huge variety of models, features, and price points. Through this project, we will explore the complex network of 
specs, brand influences, and market factors that affect mobile phone prices, which will be data-driven.

Tools and Libraries 
Data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
Data analysis techniques (correlation, feature selection) 
Machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

Methodology
1.Data Exploration - the procedure of examining unprocessed data to identify its features and trends
2.Data Preprocessing - the procedure for organizing, purifying, and converting unprocessed data so that it can be examined and utilized to 
forecast outcomes or guide choices
3.Feature Extraction - Determine features that have a significant influence by using: Statistical methods (analysis of correlation) 
Techniques for feature importance (dimensionality reduction or selection)
4.Model Building - Create training and testing sets from the dataset. Create a price prediction machine learning model by utilizing random 
forests and linear regression.
5.Model Evaluation - Use measures such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the model.
6.Feature Importance Analysis - Using model insights, confirm the significance of the features found during extraction.
7.Reporting & Visualization - Key findings are summarized in a comprehensive report that includes visuals to present to the client.

Findings 
An effective model for predicting the price of mobile phones. determining which characteristics have the biggest impact on mobile phone costs. 
practical suggestions for maximizing marketing and pricing tactics according to the significance of features.

Conclusion 
This project effectively created a machine learning model that uses important features to forecast mobile phone pricing. We determined 
the most important elements influencing price using feature extraction techniques, offering insightful information for well-informed decision-making.
